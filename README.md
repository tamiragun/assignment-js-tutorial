# JavaScript and jQuery refresher tutorial

This was an assignment for the JavaScript portion of my coding bootcamp. It is a basic tutorial that serves as a refresher to people who learned JavaScript a while ago and may have forgotten some parts. It also has a code editor in each section so the user can practice their skills.

**Stack used**: HTML - SCSS - Sass - JavaScript - jQuery

## The brief

These were the detailed instructions for the assignment:

- Using the information in your course material create an interactive website that forms a tutorial of JavaScript concepts.
- Your website should have separate web pages for each of the following headings:
  - Basic JavaScript syntax: variables, conditional statements, arrays & loops, maps, built-in functions, user-defined functions
  - Events
  - jQuery: functions, selectors, creating & appending elements, separate scripting files, events & effects, effect chaining
- Each web page explains the concepts above and allows the user to practice their knowledge.
- Be sure to style your website and make it user-friendly.
